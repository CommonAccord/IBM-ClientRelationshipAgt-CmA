Ti=Client Relationship Agreement

0.sec=Using this agreement, {P2.Handle} may order {_Program}s, Cloud and other Services, Machines and Appliances (collectively {P1.Handle} Products) and third party products and services (Non-{P1.Handle} Products) available from {P1.Handle}. Details regarding products, offerings or orders are provided in Attachments and Transaction Documents (TDs). This agreement and applicable Attachments and TDs are the complete agreement (Agreement) regarding transactions under this Agreement.

1.Ti={_Program}s

1.1.sec=A {_Program} is an {P1.Handle}-branded computer program and related material available for license from {P1.Handle} subject to the payment of charges. {_Program} details are described in an Attachment called License Information (LI). {_Program}s do not include Machine Code or Project Materials. {_Program}s are copyrighted and licensed (not sold). When {P1.Handle} accepts an order for a {_Program}, {P1.Handle} grants {P2.Handle} a nonexclusive license to: a) use the {_Program} only up to its authorizations and subject to its LI; b) make and install copies to support such authorized use; and c) make a backup copy. {_Program}s may be used by {P2.Handle}, its authorized employees and contractors only within {P2.Handle}’s Enterprise, and not to provide hosting or timesharing services to any third party. {P2.Handle} may not sublicense, assign, or transfer the license for any {_Program}. Additional rights may be available from {P1.Handle} for additional fees or under different terms. {P1.Handle} does not grant unrestricted rights to use the {_Program} nor has {P2.Handle} paid for all of the economic value of the {_Program}. Certain {_Program}s may contain third party code licensed under separate agreements identified in the LI.

1.2.0.sec=The license granted for a {_Program} is subject to {P2.Handle}:

1.2.1.sec=a. reproducing copyright notices and other markings;

b. ensuring anyone who uses the {_Program} does so only for {P2.Handle}’s authorized use and complies with the license;

c. not reverse assembling, reverse compiling, translating, or reverse engineering the {_Program}; and

d. not using any of the elements of the {_Program} or related licensed material separately from the {_Program}. The metric applicable to a {_Program} license is specified in an Attachment or TD. All licenses on a server or capacity based metric must be licensed to the full capacity of the server on which the {_Program} is installed, unless subcapacity usage is available from {P1.Handle} and {P2.Handle} complies with the applicable sub-capacity requirements.

2.Ti=Services - Cloud Services

2.1.sec=A Cloud Service is an {P1.Handle} branded offering hosted or managed by {P1.Handle} and made available via a network. Each Cloud Service is described in an Attachment or TD called a Service Description. Cloud Services are designed to be available 24/7, subject to maintenance. {P2.Handle} will be notified of scheduled maintenance. Technical support and service level commitments, if applicable, are specified in an Attachment or TD.

When {P1.Handle} accepts {P2.Handle}’s order, {P1.Handle} provides {P2.Handle} the authorizations specified in the TD. The term, including any renewal term, for a Cloud Service is described in an Attachment or TD.

{P2.Handle} may access a Cloud Service only to the extent of authorizations acquired by {P2.Handle}. {P2.Handle} is responsible for use of Cloud Services by any user who accesses the Cloud Service with {P2.Handle}’s account credentials. A Cloud Service may not be used in any jurisdiction for unlawful, obscene, offensive or fraudulent content or activity, such as advocating or causing harm, interfering with or violating the integrity or security of a network or system, evading filters, sending unsolicited, abusive or deceptive messages, viruses or harmful code, or violating third party rights. If there is a complaint or notice of violation, use may be suspended until resolved, and terminated if not resolved promptly. Unless expressly provided in a TD, {P2.Handle} is not authorized to use a Cloud Service to provide hosting or timesharing services to any third party.

3.Ti=Data Protection for Cloud Services

Each Cloud Service is designed to protect content that {P2.Handle} inputs into the Cloud Service. Except for account data, {P2.Handle} is the sole controller for any personal data included in the content, and appoints {P1.Handle} as a processor to process such personal data (as those terms are defined in EU Directive 95/46/EC). Except as otherwise specified in an Attachment or TD, {P1.Handle} will treat content as confidential by not disclosing content other than to {P1.Handle} employees and contractors for use only to the extent needed to deliver the Cloud Service. {P1.Handle} will return or destroy it upon the expiration or cancellation of the Cloud Service, or earlier upon {P2.Handle}’s request. {P1.Handle} may charge for certain activities performed at {P2.Handle}’s request (such as delivering content in a specific format). Content is not subject to any separate confidentiality agreement between the parties.

The Attachment or TD for each Cloud Service describes the security functions and features of the Cloud Service. By using the Cloud Service {P2.Handle} acknowledges that it meets {P2.Handle}’s requirements and processing instructions. {P1.Handle} will provide {P2.Handle} notice of any unauthorized third party access to {P2.Handle}’s content of which {P1.Handle} becomes aware and will use reasonable efforts to remediate identified security vulnerabilities. If {P2.Handle}’s content is lost or damaged, {P1.Handle} will assist {P2.Handle} in restoring it to the Cloud Service from {P2.Handle}’s last available backup copy in compatible format. {P1.Handle} may use processors and subprocessors (including personnel and resources) in locations worldwide to deliver the Cloud Services. {P1.Handle} may transfer {P2.Handle}’s personal data across country borders including outside the European Economic Area (EEA). A list of countries where content may be processed for a Cloud Service is available at www.ibm.com/cloud/datacenters or as described in the Attachment or TD. A list of subprocessors is available upon request.

Upon request by either party, {P1.Handle}, {P2.Handle} or their affiliates will enter into additional agreements required by law for the protection of personal data included in content such as the standard unmodified EU Model Clauses agreement pursuant to EC Decision 2010/87/EU with optional clauses removed. The parties agree (and will procure that their respective affiliates agree) that such additional agreements will be subject to the terms of the Agreement.

{P1.Handle}, its affiliates, and their third party suppliers may process, store, and use account data wherever they do business to enable product features, administer use, personalize experience, and otherwise support or improve use of the Cloud Service. Account data is all information (which may be further described in an Attachment or TD) about {P2.Handle} or its users provided to or collected by {P1.Handle} (including through tracking and other technologies, such as cookies) which is processed in accordance with the {P1.Handle} Online Privacy Statement available at www.ibm.com/privacy/details/us/en/.

4.Ti=Changes to Cloud Services

{P1.Handle} may modify a Cloud Service, without degrading its functionality or security features. Any change that affects the commercial terms (e.g. charges) of the Cloud Service will not be effective until the next agreed renewal or extension. {P1.Handle} may withdraw a Cloud Service on 12 months’ notice, unless otherwise stated in an Attachment or TD. {P1.Handle} will either continue to provide the Cloud Service for the remainder of {P2.Handle}’s unexpired term or work with {P2.Handle} to migrate to another {P1.Handle} Service.

5.Ti=Suspension of Cloud Services

{P1.Handle} may suspend, revoke or limit {P2.Handle}’s use of a Cloud Service if {P1.Handle} determines there is a material breach of {P2.Handle}’s obligations, a security breach, or violation of law. Charges will continue to accrue for the Cloud Service during any suspension. If the cause of the suspension can reasonably be remedied, {P1.Handle} will provide notice of the actions {P2.Handle} must take to reinstate the Cloud Service. If {P2.Handle} fails to take such actions within a reasonable time, {P1.Handle} may terminate the Cloud Service.

6.Ti=Services – Other Services

{P1.Handle} provides consulting, installation, customization and configuration, maintenance, and other services as detailed in an Attachment or TD. {P2.Handle} will own the copyright in works of authorship that {P1.Handle} develops for {P2.Handle} under a Statement of Work (SOW) (Project Materials). Project Materials exclude works of authorship delivered to {P2.Handle}, but not created, under the SOW, and any modifications or enhancements of such works made under the SOW (Existing Works). Some Existing Works are subject to a separate license agreement (Existing Licensed Works). A {_Program} is an example of an Existing Licensed Work and is subject to the {_Program} terms. {P1.Handle} grants {P2.Handle} an irrevocable (subject to {P2.Handle}’s payment obligations), nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, execute, reproduce, display, perform and prepare derivatives of Existing Works that are not Existing Licensed Works. {P1.Handle} retains an irrevocable, nonexclusive, worldwide, paid-up license to use, execute, reproduce, display, perform, sublicense, distribute, and prepare derivative works of Project Materials. Either party may terminate a Service if a material breach concerning the Service is not remedied within a reasonable time. {P1.Handle} will provide at least 90 days’ notice prior to withdrawal of Service. {P2.Handle} will pay charges for Services provided through the effective date of termination. If {P2.Handle} terminates without cause or {P1.Handle} terminates for breach, {P2.Handle} will meet all minimum commitments and pay termination or adjustment charges specified in the SOW or TD and any additional costs {P1.Handle} reasonably incurs because of early termination, such as costs relating to subcontracts or relocation. {P1.Handle} will take reasonable steps to mitigate any such additional costs.

7.Ti=Machines and Appliances

A Machine is an {P1.Handle}-branded device including its features, upgrades, and accessories. An Appliance is a {_Program} and Machine combination designed for a particular function. Unless otherwise provided, terms that apply to a {_Program} apply to the {_Program} component of an Appliance and terms that apply to a Machine apply to the Machine component of an Appliance. {P2.Handle} may not use or transfer an Appliance’s {_Program} component independently of the Appliance.

When {P1.Handle} accepts {P2.Handle}’s order, {P1.Handle} transfers title to Machines and non-{P1.Handle} machines to {P2.Handle} or {P2.Handle}’s lessor upon payment of all amounts due, except in the United States where title transfers upon shipment. {P1.Handle} bears risk of loss until delivery to the carrier for shipment. {P1.Handle} pays for insurance on {P2.Handle}’s behalf until delivery to {P2.Handle}’s location. {P2.Handle} must report any loss in writing to {P1.Handle} within 10 business days of delivery and follow the claim procedure. Additional charges may apply for {P1.Handle} installation more than six months after shipment. {P2.Handle} must follow instructions provided to install {P2.Handle} set up Machines.

Machines and parts removed or exchanged for upgrade, warranty service, or maintenance are {P1.Handle} property and must be returned to {P1.Handle} promptly. A replacement assumes the warranty or maintenance status of the replaced part. A Machine may include parts that are not new and in some instances Machines may have been previously installed. Regardless, {P1.Handle}’s warranty terms apply. {P2.Handle} will promptly install or allow {P1.Handle} to install mandatory engineering changes. {P2.Handle} may only acquire Machines for use within {P2.Handle}’s Enterprise in the country where acquired and not for resale, lease, or transfer. Lease-back financing is permitted.

8.Ti=Machine Code and Built in Capacity

Machines may include Machine Code (MC) and Built in Capacity (BIC). MC is computer instructions, fixes, replacements and related materials, such as data and passwords relied on, provided, used with or generated by MC, that permit the operation of the machine's processors, storage or other functionality. MC is copyrighted and licensed (not sold). {P1.Handle} only provides copies, fixes or replacements for MC for Machines under warranty or {P1.Handle} maintenance, or under a separate written agreement which may be subject to additional charges. {P2.Handle} agrees that all copies, fixes or replacements for MC will be obtained solely as authorized by {P1.Handle}. {P1.Handle} grants {P2.Handle} a nonexclusive license to use MC only (i) on the Machine for which {P1.Handle} provided it, and (ii) to access and use BIC only to the extent paid for by {P2.Handle}, activated by {P1.Handle} and subject to the Attachment called {P1.Handle} Authorized Use Table for Machines (AUT) available from {P1.Handle} and at http://www.ibm.com/systems/support/machine_warranties/m achine_code/aut.html. BIC is computing resource (e.g., processors, storage and other functionality) that {P1.Handle} provides for a Machine. Use of BIC may be restricted by contract, technological or other measures. {P2.Handle} agrees to {P1.Handle}'s implementation of technological and other measures that restrict, monitor and report on use of BIC or MC, and to install any changes {P1.Handle} provides. {P2.Handle} may not alter, reverse assemble, reverse compile, translate or reverse engineer the MC, or circumvent or interfere, by any means, with {P1.Handle}’s contractual, technological or other measures that restrict, monitor or report on use of BIC or MC. While {P2.Handle}’s license to MC is in effect, {P2.Handle} may transfer possession of the entire MC along with all of {P2.Handle}’s rights and obligations only with corresponding transfer of the Machine and a hardcopy of this MC license, and only if the transferee agrees to the terms of this MC license. {P2.Handle}’s MC license terminates immediately upon transfer. This Agreement governs MC and BIC on Machines acquired from another party. Use of BIC in excess of authorizations from {P1.Handle} is subject to additional charges.

9.Ti=Warranties and Post Warranty Support

{P1.Handle} warrants that {_Program}s used in their specified operating environment conform to their official published specifications. The warranty period for a {_Program} (not the {_Program} component of an Appliance) is one year, or the initial license term if less than one year, unless another warranty period is specified in an Attachment or TD. During the {_Program} warranty period, {P1.Handle} provides Software Subscription and Support (S&S), entitling {P2.Handle} to defect correction information, restrictions, bypasses, and new releases and versions {P1.Handle} makes generally available. Unless {P2.Handle} elects to discontinue S&S, annual S&S automatically renews at then-current charges until S&S for a version or release is withdrawn. If {P2.Handle} elects to continue S&S for a {_Program} at a designated {P2.Handle} site, {P2.Handle} must maintain S&S for all uses and installations of the {_Program} at that site.

{P1.Handle} warrants that it provides Cloud and other Services using commercially reasonable care and skill in accordance with the applicable Attachment or TD, including any completion criteria, and that Project Materials will comply with the Attachment or TD at the time of delivery. The warranty for a Service ends when the Service ends.

{P1.Handle} warrants that Machines used in their specified operating environment conform to their official published specifications. For a Machine or Appliance, the warranty period is specified in the Attachment or TD. During its warranty period, {P1.Handle} will repair or exchange the Machine without charge, as specified in the Attachment. Warranty does not apply to Machines that {P2.Handle} did not allow {P1.Handle} to install as required by the TD. {P2.Handle} may purchase warranty service upgrades and post warranty support where available. For Appliances, post warranty support includes maintenance and S&S.

If a Machine or {_Program} does not function as warranted during its warranty period and {P1.Handle} is unable to repair or replace it with a functional equivalent, {P2.Handle} may return it to {P1.Handle} for a refund of the amount {P2.Handle} paid (for recurring charges, up to twelve months’ charges) and {P2.Handle}’s license or right to use it terminates.

{P1.Handle} does not warrant uninterrupted or error-free operation of an {P1.Handle} Product or that {P1.Handle} will correct all defects or prevent third party disruptions or unauthorized third party access to an {P1.Handle} Product. These warranties are the exclusive warranties from {P1.Handle} and replace all other warranties, including the implied warranties or conditions of satisfactory quality, merchantability, non-infringement, and fitness for a particular purpose. {P1.Handle} warranties will not apply if there has been misuse, modification, damage not caused by {P1.Handle}, failure to comply with instructions provided by {P1.Handle}, or if otherwise stated in an Attachment or TD. Non{P1.Handle} Products are sold under the Agreement as-is, without warranties of any kind. Third parties may provide their own warranties to {P2.Handle}.

10.Ti=Charges, Taxes, Payment and Verification

{P2.Handle} agrees to pay all applicable charges specified by {P1.Handle}, charges for use in excess of authorizations, any customs or other duty, tax, levy, or fee imposed by any authority resulting from {P2.Handle}’s acquisitions under the Agreement, and any late payment fees. Amounts are due upon receipt of the invoice and payable within 30 days of the invoice date to an account specified by {P1.Handle}. Prepaid Services must be used within the applicable period. {P1.Handle} does not give credits or refunds for any prepaid, one-time charges, or other charges already due or paid. {P2.Handle} agrees to: i) pay withholding tax directly to the appropriate government entity where required by law; ii) furnish a tax certificate evidencing such payment to {P1.Handle}; iii) pay {P1.Handle} only the net proceeds after tax; and iv) fully cooperate with {P1.Handle} in seeking a waiver or reduction of such taxes and promptly complete and file all relevant documents. Where taxes are based upon the location(s) receiving the benefit of the Cloud Service, {P2.Handle} has an ongoing obligation to notify {P1.Handle} of such location(s) if different than {P2.Handle}’s business address listed in the applicable Attachment or TD.

{P1.Handle} may change recurring charges, labor rates and minimum commitments on three months' notice. A change applies on the invoice date or the first day of the charging period on or after the effective date {P1.Handle} specifies in the notice. {P1.Handle} may change one-time charges without notice. However, a change to a one-time charge does not apply to an order if i) {P1.Handle} receives the order before the announcement date of the increase and ii) within three months after {P1.Handle}’s receipt of the order, the product is shipped or made available to {P2.Handle}.

{P2.Handle} will i) maintain, and provide upon request, records, system tools output, and access to {P2.Handle}’s premises, as reasonably necessary for {P1.Handle} and its independent auditor to verify {P2.Handle}’s compliance with the Agreement, including MC and {_Program} licenses and metrics, such as subcapacity usage, and ii) promptly order and pay for required entitlements (including associated S&S or maintenance) at {P1.Handle}’s then current rates and for other charges and liabilities determined as a result of such verification, as {P1.Handle} specifies in an invoice. These compliance verification obligations remain in effect during the term of any TD and for two years thereafter.

11.Ti=Liability and Indemnity

{P1.Handle}’s entire liability for all claims related to the Agreement will not exceed the amount of any actual direct damages incurred by {P2.Handle} up to the amounts paid (if recurring charges, up to 12 months’ charges apply) for the product or service that is the subject of the claim, regardless of the basis of the claim. This limit applies collectively to {P1.Handle}, its subsidiaries, contractors, and suppliers. {P1.Handle} will not be liable for special, incidental, exemplary, indirect, or economic consequential damages, or lost profits, business, value, revenue, goodwill, or anticipated savings. The following amounts, if a party is legally liable for them, are not subject to the above cap: i) third party payments referred to in the paragraph below; ii) damages for body injury (including death); iii) damages to real property and tangible personal property; and iv) damages that cannot be limited under applicable law.

If a third party asserts a claim against {P2.Handle} that an {P1.Handle} Product acquired under the Agreement infringes a patent or copyright, {P1.Handle} will defend {P2.Handle} against that claim and pay amounts finally awarded by a court against {P2.Handle} or included in a settlement approved by {P1.Handle}, provided that {P2.Handle} promptly (i) notifies {P1.Handle} in writing of the claim, (ii) supplies information requested by {P1.Handle}, and (iii) allows {P1.Handle} to control, and reasonably cooperates in, the defense and settlement, including mitigation efforts.

{P1.Handle} has no responsibility for claims based, in whole or part, on Non-{P1.Handle} Products, items not provided by {P1.Handle}, or any violation of law or third party rights caused by {P2.Handle}’s content, materials, designs, specifications, or use of a noncurrent version or release of an {P1.Handle} Product when an infringement claim could have been avoided by using a current version or release.

12.Ti=Termination

Either party may terminate this agreement i) without cause on at least one month’s notice to the other after expiration or termination of its obligations under the Agreement; or ii) immediately for cause if the other is in material breach of the Agreement, provided the one who is not complying is given notice and reasonable time to comply. Failure to pay is a material breach. Any terms that by their nature extend beyond the Agreement termination remain in effect until fulfilled, and apply to successors and assignees. Termination of this agreement does not terminate TDs, and provisions of this agreement and Attachments as they relate to such TDs remain in effect until fulfilled or otherwise terminated in accordance with their terms. {P1.Handle} may terminate {P2.Handle}’s license to use a {_Program} or MC if {P2.Handle} fails to comply with the Agreement. {P2.Handle} will promptly destroy all copies of the {_Program} or MC after either party has terminated the license.

13.Ti=Governing Laws and Geographic Scope

Each party is responsible for complying with: i) laws and regulations applicable to its business and content, and ii) import, export and economic sanction laws and regulations, including those of the United States that prohibit or restrict the export, re-export, or transfer of products, technology, services or data, directly or indirectly, to or for certain countries, end uses or end users. {P2.Handle} is responsible for its use of {P1.Handle} and Non-{P1.Handle} Products.

Both parties agree to the application of the laws of the country where the transaction is performed (or for Cloud Services, the laws of the state of New York, United States, to the Agreement, without regard to conflict of law principles. The rights and obligations of each party are valid only in the country where the transaction is performed or, if {P1.Handle} agrees, the country where the product is placed in productive use, except all licenses are valid as specifically granted. If any provision of the Agreement is invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions remain in full force and effect. Nothing in the Agreement affects statutory rights of consumers that cannot be waived or limited by contract. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods does not apply to transactions under the Agreement.

14.Ti=General

Parties will not disclose confidential information without a separate, signed confidentiality agreement. If confidential information is exchanged in connection with the Agreement, the applicable confidentiality agreement is incorporated into, and subject to, this agreement.

{P2.Handle} accepts an Attachment or TD by ordering, enrolling, using, or making a payment for, the product, offering or service. Since this agreement may apply to many future orders, {P1.Handle} may modify this agreement by providing {P2.Handle} at least three months’ written notice. Changes are not retroactive; they apply, as of the effective date, only to new orders, ongoing services that do not expire, and renewals. For transactions with a defined renewable contract period, {P2.Handle} may request that {P1.Handle} defer the change effective date until the end of the current contract period. {P2.Handle} accepts changes by placing new orders or continuing use after the change effective date or allowing transactions to renew after receipt of the change notice. Except as provided above, all changes to the agreement must be in writing accepted by both parties. If there is a conflict, an Attachment or TD prevails over the terms of this agreement. {P1.Handle} is an independent contractor, not {P2.Handle}’s agent, joint venturer, partner, or fiduciary, and does not undertake to perform any of {P2.Handle}’s regulatory obligations, or assume any responsibility for {P2.Handle}’s business or operations. Each party is responsible for determining the assignment of its personnel and contractors, and for their direction, control, and compensation.

{P1.Handle} maintains a robust set of business conduct and related guidelines covering conflicts of interest, market abuse; antibribery & corruption; and fraud. {P1.Handle} and its personnel comply with such policies and require contractors to have similar policies.

{P1.Handle} Business Partners are independent from {P1.Handle} and unilaterally determine their prices and terms. {P1.Handle} is not responsible for their actions, omissions, statements, or offerings.

{P2.Handle} is responsible for obtaining all necessary permissions to use, provide, store and process content in Cloud, other Services, maintenance, or {_Program} support, and grants {P1.Handle} permission to do the same. {P2.Handle} is responsible for adequate content back-up. Some of {P2.Handle}’s content may be subject to governmental regulation or may require security measures beyond those specified by {P1.Handle} for an offering. {P2.Handle} will not input or provide such content unless {P1.Handle} has first agreed in writing to implement additional required security measures.

{P1.Handle} and its affiliates, and their subcontractors, may process and store business contact information of {P2.Handle} personnel in connection with the performance of this Agreement wherever they do business. {P1.Handle} may use personnel and resources in locations worldwide and third party suppliers to support the delivery of products and services.

Neither party may assign the Agreement, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other. Assignment of {P1.Handle} rights to receive payments and by {P1.Handle} in conjunction with the sale of the portion of {P1.Handle}’s business that includes a product or service is not restricted.

The Agreement applies to {P1.Handle} and {P2.Handle} (the signatories below) and their respective Enterprise companies who avail themselves of the Agreement. The signatories shall coordinate the activities of Enterprise companies under the Agreement. Enterprise companies include (i) companies within the same country that {P2.Handle} or {P1.Handle} control (by owning greater than 50% of the voting shares), and (ii) any other entity that controls, is controlled by or is under common control as {P2.Handle} or {P1.Handle} and has signed a participation Attachment.

All notices under the Agreement must be in writing and sent to the address below, unless a party designates in writing a different address. The parties consent to the use of electronic means and facsimile transmissions for communications as a signed writing. Any reproduction of the Agreement made by reliable means is considered an original. The Agreement supersedes any course of dealing, discussions or representations between the parties. No right or cause of action for any third party is created by the Agreement or any transaction under it. Neither party will bring a legal action arising out of or related to the Agreement more than two years after the cause of action arose. Neither party is responsible for failure to fulfill its nonmonetary obligations due to causes beyond its control. Each party will allow the other reasonable opportunity to comply before it claims the other has not met its obligations. Where approval, acceptance, consent, access, cooperation or similar action by either party is required, such action will not be unreasonably delayed or withheld.
